--- Rethinking game mode progressions ---
- Crashes when going to game mode because only body 0 init! -> now hacked!
- How do we support loading without editing?  (Need to load both)
    - Game remembers the last-loaded bodies and loads those
        - Would be nice to just save fully baked Blender file!  Can adjust Blender codebase to restore itself from file?? 
    - Need a game menu GUI (with keys) to switch modes and edit the bodies
        - Do we break cloth fitting mode?

--- Accurate vagina opener ---
- Have a way to determine penis size
- Scale vagina hole bones at runtime. Works!  Need ref size!
- Need penis sensor at vagina opening

--- Penetration work ---
- Bones in the way right now... disable?  Fix now??
- Add 'shoot cum' button?
    - Or... design of sophisticated button system and modes for video?
    ?- Rethink architecture of what VR wand axis and buttons connect to controllable objects (with mode change)
    - Also a menu to change modes?

--- Multi-object wand editing ---
?- Revive hotspots 

--- Problems ---
- Fucking problem with PhysX explosion with dual body!
- Multiple 'Base'
- Popup panel fails most times?
- UI Give space for label only?
    - Later: by category and with group labels
BUG:!! Is dependant on geometry!  Penis much denser than breasts!!

--- Later ---
- Penis lenght stretch glans
- Improvements needed on dynamic bone creation / destruction
- VR control of penis angle with vertical, stiffness with hor

--- Valid? ---
- Remove _StaticBodyCollider
- Small bug with last penis bone... 
- Collider mesh small tri removal broken!
- Array.Copy error in flex solver when dtor
- Weakness with softbody rim area selection by select_more()  Breast and penis have different densities!!
- Load of properties slow... can disable Blender & normals??
- Slow FPS!  With menu????
- All the shape keys take a long time to init!  Can group in Blender access string?


- Then...
    - Finalize morph names forever
        - Remove ball size from DAZ
        - Use '-' instead of _?
    - Man!
    - Add vagina morphs and re-build all meshes
- Ensuse normals are efficient


?- Penis bone!   Into importer!  And vert group too!
    - Can simplify away??
- Fluid collider mesh too sparce and has holes!
- Fluid errors a pain

- Remove Blender processing of MorphResult?  (Still needed??)









=== CHECKIN REMAINS ===
--- 25: Major work on BodyImport, penis fitting, morphing, body load/save and morphing
- Blender small-triange decimation causes crash!
- Major cleanup needed on how dynamic bones are obtained / cleaned
- Disabled PhysX bones to test penetration.
- Redid normals.  Make sure they are efficient
- HORRIBLE performance on even body editing.  WTF?  GUI is slowing down?  
- Game modes hacked as we couldn't enter game mode with two bodies.  Redesign!
- Penis sizing / vagina opening possible.  Do it soon!
- PhysX explosion of bones at beginning.
- Broken abillity to transport the bodies (bones fly and softbodies look horrible)
- HideShowMeshes broken.  ditch?
- Can't do multiple ops on same penis at the same time through wand cuz of 1-slot flag.
- Could improve wand joystick to control penis up/down/right/left angles instead of up/down or left/right
- Need new contract between wand controls and game actions
- Need new architecture to globally select & edit CObject (with spacial selection too)
- Body files are a basic implementation.
	- Body editing shows two bodies and their GUI!
	- Body files contain the prop buy level!
	- Body files do the filtering well but need a composite file to add an indirection level for a whole body
	- Need GUI to read / write the files in the folder to load / save / edit the body files
	

--- 24: Major rewrite around full SoftBody creation in Blender and new Unity Softbody runtime ---
- Auto foot placement disabled...need a GUI / body option for that
- Body transparency done with full duplication of all mats!
- Broken PhysX collision temp disable
- Broke cloth because of CFlex static creation removal... do in Blender too?
- Script record / playback has bad hacks
- Softbodies don't have auto prop set like old CPenis
- Leaving Flex iter count very high!  Need to tune params for softbody growth
- Bad hack with left / right VR panels!
- Disabled cam too low... enabled on debug builds?
- Bad hacks of uFlex with fluid solver and its (dumb) component search
- VRTK has a bad hack around its panel creation
