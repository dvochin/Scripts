--- Rethinking game mode progressions ---
- Crashes when going to game mode because only body 0 init! -> now hacked!
- How do we support loading without editing?  (Need to load both)
    - Game remembers the last-loaded bodies and loads those
        - Would be nice to just save fully baked Blender file!  Can adjust Blender codebase to restore itself from file?? 
    - Need a game menu GUI (with keys) to switch modes and edit the bodies
        - Do we break cloth fitting mode?

--- Accurate vagina opener ---
- Have a way to determine penis size
- Scale vagina hole bones at runtime. Works!  Need ref size!
- Need penis sensor at vagina opening

--- Penetration work ---
- Bones in the way right now... disable?  Fix now??
- Add 'shoot cum' button?
    - Or... design of sophisticated button system and modes for video?
    ?- Rethink architecture of what VR wand axis and buttons connect to controllable objects (with mode change)
    - Also a menu to change modes?

--- Multi-object wand editing ---
?- Revive hotspots 

--- Problems ---
- Fucking problem with PhysX explosion with dual body!
- Multiple 'Base'
- Popup panel fails most times?
- UI Give space for label only?
    - Later: by category and with group labels
BUG:!! Is dependant on geometry!  Penis much denser than breasts!!

--- Later ---
- Penis lenght stretch glans
- Improvements needed on dynamic bone creation / destruction
- VR control of penis angle with vertical, stiffness with hor

--- Valid? ---
- Remove _StaticBodyCollider
- Small bug with last penis bone... 
- Collider mesh small tri removal broken!
- Array.Copy error in flex solver when dtor
- Weakness with softbody rim area selection by select_more()  Breast and penis have different densities!!
- Load of properties slow... can disable Blender & normals??
- Slow FPS!  With menu????
- All the shape keys take a long time to init!  Can group in Blender access string?


- Then...
    - Finalize morph names forever
        - Remove ball size from DAZ
        - Use '-' instead of _?
    - Man!
    - Add vagina morphs and re-build all meshes
- Ensuse normals are efficient


?- Penis bone!   Into importer!  And vert group too!
    - Can simplify away??
- Fluid collider mesh too sparce and has holes!
- Fluid errors a pain

- Remove Blender processing of MorphResult?  (Still needed??)
