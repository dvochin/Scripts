=== REVIVE Game ===

- Ideas to stabilize fingers:
	- Add springs between fingers
	- Have a 'preamble position' before engaging in a new 'caress' (e.g. penis, vagina, breasts)
	- Reduce skin friction
	- Fingers go backward when pushed hard against a surface... can reduce that effect via collider slide??

- Jerk off
	- Would be safer to 'init' the hand rotation before jerk off cycle
		- Storing 'hand-calibrated hand pos/rot would make arms move smoother
	- Get fucking init faster!
	- Fucking finger explosion getting long
	- Need various anchor points for hand?
		- Need to adjust to cock size... or just spring it?
	- Need to remove rotation to _oJoint_ExtremityToPin?
	- Hack on rot spring... another enum??
	- VrWandMove_Begin args are crap... redo or merge?  Still need this class or merge into arm?
	- Hacked source body to also simplify hands out... revise?!?
	- Hacked spring and anchor... need tough springs and right distance!
	- Idea wrap fingers around a fake cylinder same diam as cock?

- Direct cock movement
	- Need MUCH stiffer pos, rot springs!
	- Need the Flex equivalent of longer fingers!
	- Need to automatically interpret the user's look into semi-automated caresses that make sense for body parts:
		- Looking at cock cusps the hand and strokes it via proper path
		- Looking at tits massages them properly.
		- Looking far away plots a reasonable-looking path.
	- Need to rethink damping on arms... looks weird... only damped hands?
	- Add speech commands for the unit testing control we need.


- Wand grip
	- Hand grip adjust in the code is a big hack but does have promise...
	- Cursor not showing anymore cuz of removal of dual joy axis.
	- Didn't we have a hand mode where it can squeeze cock?  Need that!!
	- Hand shape keys not working!
	- There used to be a strong grip mode... wtf is it?

- Save of body shape not working!
	
- Have body default loaded at start
- Redesign wand soon
    - Dual action per axis gone or not??  (action1, select)
    - VrWandMove_Begin?  (remmed out in wand)
        - CBone bakes!!
        - HandCollider_EnableDisableCollisionWithOtherCollider
        - _oVrWandMoveable
    - Direct versus remote still on?
    - Cum control was in there!
    - Caress system pretty neat.
        - Drive of hand clasping from VR axis gone tho...  why was this taken out??  (for speech??)
        - Need a 'auto masturbation' mode that automatically changes to jerk off mode when approaching penis.
            -IDEA:!!! For now guide hand close to penis and a menu appears!!
        - We used to be able to push into breast, penis, etc... pull this back!

- Speech!
    - Add commands to help out!

=== DEV ===
-- Scripting export cleanup
	- jscript export name
	- Port code for 'Browser', BodyBase, GameInstance, etc
	- WTF script play still on CBodyBase??


- Need to rewrite Unity / Web codebase:
	- Unity creates / destroys simple granular panels.  
	- Web code very simple: Display what Unity wants and send events.  Unity always in charge.  No inter-panel comm.
- Need to create multiple panel: CWebPanel
	- Arg for which codebase: WandButtons, Tab panel, etc.
- Need to first create the tiny wand panel with the main game buttons.
	- Does it expand for minimalist UI on some buttons?
	- The game modes create the pinned panels around the bodies.
		- Left panel is the main one, right one for support panels: BodyDef, PoseSaveLoad, etc
		- LATER: Could have panels being moved by wand with a wand button.


+ Creation / destruction a mess... what part of game creates / destroys?  Game modes? global?
    - We need the GUI we need created / destroyed as Unity changes modes.

=== NEXT ===
- Can finally load body shapes..
    - What is the best way for body ctor to load intersting body?
        - in C# or jscript?
- Create a BodyDef_Load/Save()
	- New bodies load the 'Default' body at startup.
- BodyDef load does not update the sliders.
	- Request a view refresh when tab is clicked!
		
=== TODO ===
+ Need a coherent top-level UI strategy between all the game modes / sub modes...
    - e.g. 'play mode' (Flex enabled) versus 'config mode'
    - But posing always applies!
    - But morphing only in config mode...
    - so for now just cheap out and have play / config in and out create the GUI?
? Need selection framework that unifies Unity + Jscript
	- Ties in with toolbar and its actions... maybe toolbar can be decoupled from view and just fire 'generic actions'?
	- Toolbar can be constructed by the view's array of generic actions
- Web UI has no concept of what body it is modifying... implement body selection?
- Rethink game modes toward Unity-centric flow:
    - Web can have buttons but they notify Unity and it does everything.
    - Full de-select / select architecture.  When exiting a game mode it cleans up all its panes and entering new one creates them.
    - Rewrite web codebase so that Unity can create / destroy tab panes and their views as needed.
- Rework Posing:
	- Deactivates colliders for a while?
	- Kinematic move?
	- What to do about the fucking fingers exploding?
	- Fix the softbodies (In game mode)
- Two-body posing:
	- Need a new CEditor-based pane with PoseBody1, PoseBody2 and possibly other value tweaking:
		- Tweaking values: base pose orientation delta (typically 180 about up axis)
			- Also possibly adjust pose front/back delta, torso height, torso angle?
- Get to dual-wand animation work on interesting bodies asap
	
=== LATER ===
- Add a toolbar for the tree property viewer: property configuration, range extension, reset to default, etc
- Need to revisit Unity-side scripting... currently on CBodyBase!  To CGame?8
    - Web property viewers need to remember how to access their Unity equivalent object... CGame?  BodyBase?  Which body?  Selected??

=== OPTIMIZATIONS ===

=== REMINDERS ===

=== IMPROVE ===
- Async call in editor data save could be used elsewhere?  Move to global functions?
- Toolbars could be auto-created from a list of actions in some smart mechanism?

=== NEEDS ===

=== DESIGN ===
-- New design of Unity / Web interaction --
- Need to overhaul 'exportation' of Unity codebase symbols to unity script and web = EXPORTS collection


- Problem with abstraction of load / save across all views... tree of properties never need to 'load'
- CEditor contains a lot of functionality that would benefit other views:
	- The popup record editor
- Toolbar functionality a mess... had to be copied to work around that nasty problem with only one set being visible, but I know more now so retry?

=== QUESTIONS ===

=== IDEAS ===

=== LEARNED ===

=== PROBLEMS ===
- Current tab-based interface super clumsy.  Reduce usage of tabs with other widgets.  Toolbar??
- Why are some sliders created on non-leaves of the tree??

=== WISHLIST ===

=== SORT ===
