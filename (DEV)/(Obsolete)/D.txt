/*=== DESIGN DISCUSSIONS ===
-- 3D Vagina creation --
- Now have good texture, create ZBrush mesh, make design decisions on how much of mesh we change, start applying 'spring pins' to vagina control points to open&close!
- Lucky Break!: Latest vagina (with slit) and enhanced geometry fixed most of the problems!  SBDetail35, mIsoSingle1, copyIsoSurface, .005f tetra range -> Still has patchy pins but look really nice!!!
	- Bad carving of tetramesh however... including some rogue connections between sides!  Not sure this can be fixed?
- Idea: also pin by proximity to soft body edge... just 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 points ok for now...
- Our biggest problem is obvious skip of particles between the long edges... FIX FIRST!!

-- world-space morphs of breasts & top clothing --
- A *MAJOR* breakthrough.  We invest heavily in world-space modifications of all kinds: move, scale, rotate (from different point)
- Have 'per breast' origin and 'between breast' cleanup of cleavage to prevent breast inter-penetratino.
- Add adjustable blend of clothing to its skinned area...
- Add blend between the two breasts

-- Penis linked capsule drive --
- Duplication of bones between penis and body makes things a bit more complex for setting penis shape at init... is there a way to simplify??
- Problem:  Penis looks horribly with fast movement!  collider size change??
- Problem with penis base (where cap occurs) -> triangles that bridge entire opening! (see screenshots) Weird!!
- Experiement with driving position of joints to make dick longer & shorter!  (Would look good???)
- Why is texture change between dick and torso now so apparent??
	- Related to why textures no longer blend together??  Is it because of normals?  Because of vert glueing?

-- Remap of crotch --
- Caused MAJOR difficulties...  Now the border between borders is even more noticable... looking worse with distance...  Why did it appear???																																																																																																																																																																																												
	- Changing border color in photoshop changes color of lines -> not enough 'border' around Zbrush remap!
- Something broken in CopyAnchorsFromBodyPartMesh()!!

-- Substances --
- Pretty good implementation of specular on breasts and penis... now finish the job with global setting on whole body for men and woman
- OPT: Asking pretty big load on game with regen of 4K textures... possible to reduce load for simple specular map changes??
- Substances a huge asset on fabric... but now need to learn what it can do for borders!
- Use substances to implement runtime opacity of cloths!
- Body wetness,Oily breasts, Wet/dry penis tip -> specular map pushed!, Vagina wetness, Nipple & vagina change!, Cosmetics like eye color, lip gloss color, nail polish color, Texture stretch on penis, nipples, vagina??

-- Woman pubic hair --
- Pretty decent job for a 2-day effort with substance -> we're going with them!
- Could improve with high-resolution photos of a few pubic hair (the ones we have hairs are only 1-2 pixels wide -> we need 4-10 pixels wide!)
- Map more parameters to Unity like V-width, V-height, multipliers on size
- Add two more layers of skinned pubic hair?
- Can we control SVG curve points from Unity?  Or Unity creates bitmap for pubic hair masks sent to Substance?

-- Animation design development --
	- The big question is: store pose in animation curves, or go with our 'transaction system' with full undo / redo / rewind, etc?
		- Also have to concern ourselves with network sync!
	- How do we save a 'pose'?
	- How do we link one pose leading into another (and the 'graph' that makes them possible??)
		- Code: It's the simplest way... the pose itself is in a file and the file is refered to in code to create the graph.
- In its (first) and simplest implementation, a pose is the feet and 'sexbone' position & rotation of two characters.
	- The rest (like arm placement, chest shakes, head movement, etc) are all 'decorations'
	- Later implementations can have extra stuff like when a hand is a 'structural pin', etc
	- First tests are based on no props (e.g. standing with no obstacles around), then we can start designing in things like chairs, stools, bed edge, etc
- Do we store poses in our custom files or in anim files??
	- Anim files have a nice Unity GUI that can be useful to edit
	- Custom files would more easily support transactions, undo/redo, etc.

-- New SoftBody merging --
- We make the simplifying assumption that CBody ALWAYS merges two or more skinned mesh + soft body and branches them out (like last implementation)
- CSoftBodyLocal won't be used... We assume that each skinned mesh that CBody can merge has a child called 'SoftBody' that contains a non-skinned mesh with its pins at the same location as its parent
- Currently we don't skin wrap the breasts onto the top (bad skinning transition) so that leaves verts mapped to root... this the best??

-- Caress system --
- Develop a 'mesh walker' that can quickly traverse the surface of the mesh to guide actors (such as hands) to CMeshTarget objects
	- These CMeshTarget objects are placed at design-time in various erotic zones and contain information used at runtime to guide actors from one CMeshTarget to another
	- One info is the minimum level on 'how turned on' the host body is to determine if it's appropriate for the actor should go there or not
- CActor owns mesh walking instance vars and most logic.  CBody init constructs the helper maps to speed up walking.
- Caressing a body part stats by obtaining a triangle ID from a CHarnessSphere, reading its hints, applying base arm drive and staring mesh walking


-- Steps in proper body bone structure construction --
- Quick evaluation of bone driving vs magnet
- Evaluation of which damping method is best
- Design of 'Anchor' for actors such as hands (e.g. to fingers, palm, etc)
- How to coalesce all the parts of the body (e.g. the four limbs, torse, head) into a structure that is clearly visible to anim tracks.
- Add quick colliders to the hand for feedback to the soft body! :)

-- Misc --
- If we implement a softbody vagina, then we *need* to remove particleices where the opening is.  -> Same functionality can separate the breasts!

-- PROPERTY DESIGN --
- Need to know when it has changed from the last time it was sent over the network, so need an 'intelligent object' that manages itself
	- Types of properties: float, int, Quaternion, Vector3
- The following segments of code can change a property... all from the same property code.
	- GUI through CBone and user dragging of gizmos. (both configurable joints and transform.position and transform.rotation)
	- Game load and save code: e.g. loading a position.
	- Network activity from another user
- Needs to support graceful changes from old value to new value (LERP) -> Q: From all clients?  Q2: What time frame?
	- That means every frame needs to iterate all properties?
- A property has these fields:
	- When entity to call when a value changes... through '.Net events queues'? -> _oBody
	- an 'EntityID' that is unique to its container (e.g. a CBody)
	- a 'PropertyID' that is globally 
- Major design lines:
	- At every network frame, network code iterates through ALL properties owned by this game instance to ask them if it needs serialization

-- DESIGN NEXT POSING --
- Finally have rudimentary posing...
- Some form of sine-wave movement would be hot!
- Also need to hook in the hip as a spring... with woman orthogonal to pussy entry and men to thrusting angle
- Add magnet to end of penis?
- Some way to store quick animations would be great!
- IDEA: a 'standing height' generator which modifies root position and leg angles for convincing squat-to-upright animation.
	- This can greatly increase the flexibility of dual-body animations: simply increase height of one body.
- Adjusting gametime damping very important.
- We need a 'body selection' user mechanism

-- DESIGN ANIMATION STABILITY --
- Version 1.0 has user controlling hip and penetrating himself...  Have to make that believable.
	- One major problem is top of body swaying with hip... adding pin to neck or head helps... toggle that 'mode' in and out when user takes hip control??
- So for posing we could either pose with hip and abdomen & chest strong angles... or hip with neck as child being moved / oriented with weak bone angles
- Neck (or head) spring is way to go... far easier and more convincing, plus awesome looking movement on hip thrusting, chest thrusting, etc.
- Q: Hip has Pin-Hip being kinematic with real hip with confJoint.  Neck & hands have spring joint on Spring transform itself... can go all with spring joints??
- WOW: With dual-spring design of hip & chest, can even rotate owning 'Pin-Body' around y +-90 deg and character rotation appears very credible!!!
	- Fucking motion is much sexier with heavy pelvic trust... maybe add a bit of z movement of hip (harder to do) and we're good to go!

-- USER ABILITY TO POSE AND SEQUENCE --
- A scripting language would be ideal.
	- The ability of the pose creation gameplay to generate a string that can be evaluated to generate that pose would be great... same with read!
- We have a go with jscript eval!
	- So we now implement all top-level behavioral stuff in jscript so parts of it can easily be extended by users
	- Have pose load & save store to code???

?-- FFOR on animation work based on 'ragdoll & physics spring' --
- Single frame static positions for all actors critical
	- Each is made of a position & orientation for hip, with optional pins for extremities like feet and arms.
		- Once extremities are pinned, they are assumed to be needed to form a convincing pose and are taken off the list of what can be moved by user for this pose
	- Made more complex by there being two characters:  A compatibility map will be needed?  (or just leave this to the user's choice?)
	- (Someday, maybe an animator can be hired to enter more complex/convincing animations between the static poses)
- Mecanim is getting in the way in several areas:
- Old Physics-based 'ragdoll rig' really had a lot to offer: 
	- Responding to collisions in a visually believable way
	- Easy entry of single-frame poses
	- Forgiving nature during gameplay when user drags/animates a control point too far, etc

-- Problem fixed with normal calculation for duplicate verts in PhysX --
- Penis has texture seam under it that shows hugely... fixed by normal map?
	- Setting shader to 'bumped diffuse' makes entire dick very dark... are normals ok?  (How come normal diffuse appears shaded ok??)
	- Looks seamless with or without bump diffuse as exported by 3dsMax... meaning our normal calc probably screw it up because of dual verts at under-penis seam!
	- VERY WEIRD: Mobile 'bumped diffuse' doesn't appear dark like normal 'bumped diffuse'!!
		- Clue on that: normal version requires tangeants and ours are obviously screwed up!  -> mobile requires just normal! -> so use mobile??
	- Problem appears subtler with mobile bump (and default imports all around) and us not importing PhysX normals (no norm calc!)
		- Looks bad with default import and import normals from PhysX
		- Looks so-so with recalcnormal... :-(


=== DITCHED DESIGNS ===
-- Vagina penetration and solid stability -- (DITCHED -> going with skinned vagina)
- Local skinning to modify the features such as Labia and inner lip are a must... how to modify what we have for local skinning?
	- Reuse this for nipples and nipples on shirts!
- Put back slit and improve... (we also need for breasts without cutting shirt... tought!)
- Preliminary tests with stabilizing forces were mediocre -> would probably oscillate, be unstable, require high CPU and difficult to improve.  
	- Backstopping a solid is probably best.
	- Right now solid fails on NaN... probably have to fix CSoftBody to trim back vertex?
	- Also have to do slit for this testing.
	- Locate back tetra verts, pin solid (or use our new spring pin) and retry.
- REMEMBER: Screwed up pos of vagina!
-BUG: bad pinning of vagina... caused by pinning from tris instead of verts??
	- Caused by CSoftBody.OnStart() call to FindVertByPos with too big a range.
	- Screwed up pos of vagina and that's why a range of zero won't work!  Fix the mesh positions!
--- Old CBody discussion? ---
-- How the PhysX mesh and the skinned mesh are merged together during init --
- The PhysX mesh has pins colored at x, and 'back vertices' (e.g. those that we inserted in max to make a solid) as color y.
- During the merge, we iterate through the pins:
	- In our list of triangles we replace the solidmesh-side pin vertices with the skinnedmesh-side pins vertices.
		- As Unity skinning will still move these vertices, the row of triangles nearest the pins will correctly merge with the body without visible seams
- We iterate through the solidmesh vertices...
	- Vertices that are pins (from their vertex color x) create a 'CPinSkinned' with link to the equivalent skinnedmesh-side vertex (and the (useless?) solidmesh-side vertex?)
		- We 'search' through the skinned mesh to find the vertex at the same position... our 'twin'.  Skinning this vertex at runtime will determine the position of that CPinSkinned (and their slave CPinTetra)
		- We don't insert the solidmesh-side pin vertices into the skinnedmesh-side vertex list!  (Tris have been ported, vertex is now useless dead weight that would slow skinning!)
	- Vertices that are 'backside' (vert color y) exist only to correctly shape the solid and are useless to Unity for drawing.
		- Backside vertices are not ported over, and (during next tri iteration) triangles that have one of these indexed is not ported over to skinnedside-mesh.	
-- How the PhysX mesh and the skinned mesh are merged together during gameplay --
	- At every frame, PhysX will update the position of all vertices in the solid mesh...
		- Through the map of solidmesh-verts to skinnedmesh-verts, we update the positions of only the non-pin and non-backside verts.

/*=== DAY LOGS ===
- After merge of biped with CBone, discovery of jscript.eval and file save:
	- Definitively will implement behavior to be extensible by user at gametime with jscript...
	- Started with left hand separation from joint spring... sort of works... start testing behavior expression through hands!
		- Anything other than hand is thus far just for display and posing...  hands are the behavior expressions, along with face look and face expressions.
	- IDEAS: List of interesting 'things to do' in range of each hand... and iterate through them at random!
		- Identify target sectors of interest that will dicate the hand rotation before approach
		- Q: How to avoid weird rotations on shoulders?
- Just got SmartGWT-to-Unity message working!
	- Now begin working on a simple 'property browser' that can read Unity selected objects through reflection!
- Huge all-over-the-place day from soft body to cloth to colliders:
	- cloth is hugely influenced from 20ms for 2 spheres to 90ms for 50 spheres on a 14K vert cloth -> Dynamic cloth is of use for design-time clothing
- Go back to making soft body work with cloth...
	- Have re-inserted good bones -> user plays with that for tits and that's good enough for V1.0
- Now have near walking!!
	- Remove drivers on legs and add knee target?
	- Damping on rigid body a huge revelation... find good default value... and adjust other joint dampers?
	- Root pin being moved by feet was brilliant... add smart auto height dependant on distance between toes: Use pythagorus
- Now have woman7/new vagina
	- a 1.0 unit dick goes far into th leg -> will be very difficult to pull off. Start making 0.4 (0.5 with +0.1) fit
	- Try sending non-solid to see diff...
	- We badly need a backstopping scheme: either many pins in the back that don't move toward/away... or an out-of-band collision system to slow the dick down at entry and invoke springs on softbody vagina to open before entry
-- Proper pinning of vagina. Research during nasty pinning problems --
- Increasing physics iteration helps.
- Stiff volume & stetch makes really bad!
- No thickness looks worse
- Very thick looks not different, but PhysX GUI reveals a nasty tetramesh with parts dropping!
- Damping is our likely next step... just send bigger mesh and partly reject the external rings...
- Still at the 'copy iso' mode... keep it??
- Reverify if bending legs still really needed!
- 10:15: Worse with normal copyIsoSurface() with pin range at .004 and geo 55
- 10:18: adding gemoetry with copyIsoSurface() helps a bit... adding more now and reducing pin range to .004 and geo 65
- 10:22: geo 65 pin rnage .004 is small improvement but a lot of geo and we get 'dancing'... not the way.
- 10:27: Removed mIsoSingle... a reasonable improvement!  But a lot of geo!  (geo 65, trange .004f, mIsoSingle0, copyIsoSurface())
- 10:40: geo 40, mIsoSingle1, tri .006: Not too bad, lots of geo, .006 range good 
- 2:50: mIsoSingle0, copyIso, .004 - new pin by vertex = starting to look better but too much edge overlay, and solid collapsing as empty inside!
- 2:55: mIsoSingle1, copySurf, .004
- 5:11: High graph geo, narrowed vagina, dens50, .004, cloth
- Final solution: Go with mIsoSingle0 and pin every particle on the graphical mesh border (including the 'depth' one underneath skin)
- Concept: Reducing graphic geo and beefing up tetra geo makes for automatic damping at the border!  NO
- Bottom line: Need more geometry on skinned side to properly attract and guide the thinnest row of tetrapins near the edge of soft body.
- Adding x and y drive to thighs and extending x by .07 and y by .13 still gives nice sexy body but more area for penetration and stretching!
- Reducing geometry at outside rim of softbody would dampen??  May need to try!
*/


/*===== PHYSICS =====
=== DESIGN ===
- Need new global property editing between all our manager classes and various PhysX objects... all the way from Unity editor to PhysX objects!
- Reconnsider OnPhys_Message... broadcast to cloth and softbodies????
- Consider restore of soft body bones to init state to avoid rebooting Unity all the time!
- Init takes too long, shorten!
- Debug window refresh needed for SoftBody.  Fix 'ApplyLinks'!!! //###
- Now in sync mode.  Simplifies things but are we killing performance???
	- Would starting of simulation in earliest update and blocking on LateUpdate ok?
	- Is FixedUpdate totally useless now?
	- No framerate throttling... is PhysX slowing us down that much??

=== UNCERTAINTIES ===
   
=== BUGS ===
- Very annoying the crash of Unity after every run... fix!!
- Physx window grabs right mouse button to drag!!!
- Mesh restore broken... consider fix by reimport of mesh??

=== WEAK ===
? The offset for cap pin is awful!
? Have some rotation stuff in CPinSkinned.OnSimulatePre... needed?
- In order to merge the force of gravity in the game we have to design the default breasts to be quite 'perky'... but appearance suffer!
	- Sure could use a 'fast relax' modifier to smooth out the kinks!!

=== STUDY ===
- //###LEARN: VRD Debugger for Phys??
? "Two way interaction works best when NX_SF_SEQUENTIAL_PRIMARY is set in the primary scene. If not set, collision and attachment artifacts may happen." 
? "NX_SBF_DISABLE_DYNAMIC_CCD  Disable continuous collision detection with dynamic actors. Dynamic actors are handled as static ones. "

=== TODO ===
- USE EXCEPTIONS!!
- Need to develop public PhysX properties NOW

*/



/*=== STEPS TO VICTORY ===

- Enter basic copy protection for 'Alpha 2'
*/



/*=== PROBLEMS ===
- Legacy cloth-based clothing
	? Problem with shimmer of cloth vertices... seems to happen only on tin strips?  -> Playing with physics materials can make a lot of difference??  (Adhere useful?)  (Cloth-based clothing only)
	- Problem with object friction... adopt 'ice' as default physics material?  Modify so it's more like teflon?
	- Problem with cloth requiring no rotation... possibly translation too?
	- Problem with cloth stretching too easily past its starting state -> Need to compensate by shrinking it when sending to PhysX!
	- Problem with cloth bounds... can clip when moving off starting location!
? Problem with skin colliders when translating body... goes twice as far!  Is it a problem tho?  (or do we always keep body at 0,0,0?)
? Possible problem exposed with fidgety nature of softbody when editing a CPinTetra force param... are quirks in calls to PhysX possible??
	+ Ultra weird problem even with TetraSpring Unity object deleted... click on other Unity nodes and huge jerks in soft body!!  WTF?????????
	+ Even deleting our CPinTetra with spring (and making sure the possibly-offending PhysX code isn't called) gives the behavior... WEIRD!!
	-> In other words there is something that Unity sends PhysX when we just select different nodes that makes mesh quiver... made much more visible with our new TetraSpring!
- A delays seems to have been inserted with latest rewrite of softbody... mesh is visibly stretched at collider line... investigate!
- Possibly (major) design issues with some algorithms getting and settings triangles on submeshes and other on whole mesh! -> Like what walker experienced during init with tris already set and thinking 'non manifold'

=== BUGS ===
? WTF is going on with needing to raise BoneBypass y by 0.005???  Seems to be intermittent... a centering issue?  Influenced by capping??  3dsMax not sending skinned mesh at idle??
? Very weird erratic movement of CPinSkinned or CPinTetra when reducing the breasts to 0.8.  Is it Unity-sent data that is erratic of PhysX moving pins!?  Caused by verts too close together??
? Cleanup of PhysX is a lot better now but at every game init/shutdown cycle there is still a large drop in fps performance... clean up correctly!!
	- Probably related to the 'debug wireframe mesh' shown -> it still knows how to draw these so large data structure are left for sure!
- Bug with CPinSkinned connecting if CBody root is not at origin!  (Surprised this much works tho!) -> Global coordinates during pinning???
- PhysX core implementation returns the mBuffer vertices as NaN when too many meshes are created.  THIS COULD HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS ON HOW MANY SOFT BODIES WE HAVE IN GAME AND HOW COMPLEX!!
- Weird bug with PhysX moving particles randomly... WTF???
- Game still updates 3D cursor even when it has lost focus.
- Walker are instantiate with 0.2 scale because of relation to CHarnessSphere... can cause problem??
- Visible differences between the halves of CHarnessSphere and walker
- Existing anchors on main body become invalid when new tris and copied...
- This problem with non-manifold mesh detected during walker init is probably related to backface verts of breasts being copied?  (We're copying a solid over to a hollow mesh!!!)
- Existing main mesh anchors no good by tri once we add tris... have to reset them by one of their vert! -> Do main mesh conversion now...
- CHarnessSphere and walker still created with rigidbodies!?
- Right arm moving much slower as it doesn't have the capsule colliders!
	-> Copy colliders from left!
	-> This influencing walker not moving right hand?
- Important params of config joint like xyz springs, rotation springs, etc!
- Cloth dissapears when too close -> bounds!
- WTF is softbody moving by itself??  Seem to happen with Unity PhysX scene stressed... how can it transfer over?
- Very faint single-white-pixel glimmer between body and breasst mesh?  (and also between sky background and edge of body... seems like a graphic card problem?!

=== ANNOYANCES ===
? Getting annoying that Unity locks our dll once loaded!  Find out what it calls!!
    
=== DESIGN ISSUES ===
? SoftBody accepting collections of meshes is not compatible with the existing one-cutter-per-mesh!  (Cutter currently 'owned' by CSoftBody!!!)
- Breasts look bad under gravity but penis needs it... Switch off gravity at the soft body level??
- Define collision layers between skinned colliders and our bone colliders!!  Same??  different??  Are actors like hands and feet on different layer??
- CHarnessSphereActorWalker being derived from us makes no sense related to our collider functionality.  Move our skin position update stuff to a base class and let walker class derive from that instead
- CSoftBody overrides nicely but leaves its children with full arrays that are useless.. clean them!
- Problem with gravity making breasts look bad... get rid of it?  and just apply to cloth??
- Disable cam movement when panel shown?  (Cound cause 'poke through' if we allow!)

=== LIMITATIONS ===
+ Huge limitation: we have to init each character at origin!  (Ok to move later)
- CBody functionality *must* have skinned mesh in idle pose (all bones as design during idle pose) for mouse ray to work and code to function.  (Alternative would involve calculating every skinned vertex before editing!!)
	- Still valid if we design colliders in gametime?
? CSoftBody requires that host mesh has the same material as it... (like Vagina to Hip).  For Penis this is not true... I had to convert a couple nearly-invisible polys on the host mesh to the penis material to get our code to work!!

=== IDEAS ===
- Use File.Encrypt() for anything??
+ Implement 'layered clothing' simply by increasing the cloth collider clearance for outer cloth layers!  (Assumes inner cloth layers are 'tight' so as not to simulate past outer layers!)
	- Implement bras & sports bra this way... with a shirt on top!!
- Give player option to reduce Time.TimeStep, and gravity!
- Putting annoying design time artifacts in a layer just like default but hiddent during dev would be useful?
- For smart & easy camera targets, create a new CCamTarget script to dynamically calculate its position (e.g. halfway between tip of cock and vagina entry, etc...)
- For most of the editors, we could improve their visual feedback past Debug.DrawLine by storing positions of debug objects and drawing with the more powerful Gizmo.xxx
- Can now easily display visual feedback for vertex editing... makes a really neat game feature possible -> soft move of mesh areas! :)
+ 'ISO SINGLE' mode of constructing tetramesh makes it truly solid!  (not makes it hollow!!) -> Weird it takes less particles tho???  TEST!!
+ For volume expansion, study the cube example where a tetramesh is generated programmatically... try to expand that one!!
- Soft body twists the mesh out of shape per triangle... smooth out the normals so it doesn't look as bad under lighting??
- Pass 'metainfo' from 3dsMax by creaing 'dummy nodes' under a Unity-known node at a known location with the metainfo in their names!! -> Useful for things like collider definition!
- Construct a temporary skinned mesh with the just verts I need skinned at runtime and call 'BakeMesh'
- Create a 'plane shape' collider to act as ground in PhysX (to catch cloths)  -> Could be of use elsewhere?
- Transform class has many useful functions such as root, tag, isChild, etc... explore!
- For breast morphs... have a sort of 'world space' mover expander
	- Will need to be mathematically-based in order to avoid pokethrough during expand.
	- The breast base needs to keep being pinned to body... with a blend by distance to nearest pin
	- The other way to transform existing cloth is with our (future) dynamic cloth system and its sphere colliders

=== GAMEPLAY POSSIBILITIES ===
- Simple autorotate of hip x,y,z and spine x,y,z is highly effective and trivial to do!  -> Secondary motion to pose
	- A simple rotate of chest x when woman is feeling 'sexy'... same with hip shift...
- Is PhysX's heightfield shape collider of any use to us??

=== OPTIMIZATION ===
- Mouse cursor & collider depth
- Revisit all imports and scale them at import time to keep gametime transform at 1.0
	- Revisit all scales so x,y,z = 1.0
- Cloth cooking cache is overkill??
- ifdef these safety checks for debug build / release build

=== SIMPLIFICATIONS ===
- Remove cloth caching?
- Remove spring force class in C++ -> Unity now


=== Graphic Assets TODO ===
- Feet near ankle looks bad +++
- Small cut near foot mesh cut +
- Weird normal problem around butt with weird bends...
- Redesign 'higher' breasts so we can apply higher gravity
- The penis has a lot of wasted vertices at the tip (previously to allow foreskin slide)  Keep???
- Simplify the penis bone structure or keep for design-time definition?
	- Add a new bone at the base of the penis so user can control how to point the soft body!
- Change orientation of aeroala and nipple so user can just push them out with one axis!
	- Do we create bones for nipples and aerola?
- We will need force CPinSkinned to keep slit more closed!
- Need to redesign vagina with legs up??
- Legs bending forward on woman looks awful!  Add geometry & smooth skin!
- Add 'footshape mesh' for visual guide on where to place feet
- Penis host rim on main mesh not completely surrounding with material... why did 'shrink' fail??
- Fix once and for all all the fucking bad materials like eye surface, eyelash, hair and so on!!!
- Man's bone issues: lCollar and forearm axis diff than woman!!
	- Not using man pelvis bone because of colliders... add collider exception?
	- How to orient man's sexbone!  A huge design issue because of erection direction & softbody implications!
	- Disabled man's carpal1&2 in 3dsMax so we can use same code as women's!





=== STILL VALID? ===


=== TODO ===
-- GUI --
- How to edit proper range of target var (+/- 100 or 0-100?)
	- Default value on slider key?
	- Snap value on sliders?
	- Give the slider two extra slides at top and bottom to animate -> Creates anim curves and posts!
- Standardize the visual layout of the editor OnGUI with constant captions, tips, help button, etc.
- No concept of selected body.  Affects pose loading & saving

-- WISHLIST --
- Collider size need to autoscale as we scale breasts... but how to do these only?

-- PERFORMANCE --
- Add ifdefs to some of the code we use to facilitate development
- Enhance skin helper code to move colliders when we adjust bones!

-- Soft Body --
+ Send colliders to PhysX!
- Apply properties to all soft bodies! -> redesign!
- Slit on breasts that won't cut clothing!
- SoftBody shutdown doesn't recover anymore -> a nasty problem because of triangle submeshes!

-- PhysX collision (Unity) --
- Finalize gravity!
- Are our Body1..4 slots really needed?
	- How to init body to these slots at gametime

-- Editor collider/anchor editing --
- 'Create walker' functionality has a few problems: Overhang should stay, radius should always be 1, go in proper folder!
- Copy colliders from part to main mesh, not just anchors!

-- Walker --
- Jumping and jerking sucks... slerp it or reduce force??
- Add speed: Currently we're going slow over dense mesh areas (e.g. nipples)  fix this or leave it?
- Add direction: between two targets?
- Add some randomness to finger spread, open and close, thumb...
? Appeared to be a bug with normal after a soft of 'reset' with walker
? Why is walker so far away in many situations?
? Design issue with both hands accessing same walker target: Only one animates?

-- Caress System --
- Continue work on hand & fingers... stabilize finger collisions... or drop them from physics??
- We will need fingers colliding with body spheres for caress system to be workable... :-(
- Enhance to adjust distance to skin (& push into soft part of body like breasts!) -> Will be a user key to 'push in' :)

-- Posing --
- Create 'transparent hands and feet prints' for intuitive placement when posing

=== JUST BROKEN ===
- Connect to walker broken

=== REMEMBER ===
- Important params of config joint like xyz springs, rotation springs, etc!
- Calibrate spine
- Finalize physics layers once and for all.  Definitively need one for 'Body1', 'Body2'
- Joint fixed vs. free problem... would be nice to not have to use tiny-range for axis we want to lock (better for performance?)  Will slerp run?
- Drive strenghts variables are very important... globalize!
- Remember time delta in PhysX is hacked... redo implementation on samples?
- Max texture size during build... make sure we don't reduce our textures!!
- Remember Application.genuine for extra safety!

=== SORT ===
- How to move / rotate whole body?  Move & rotate both feets at the same time with a special command (and it still calculate root pos??)
- Set foot pin angle flat

=== CURRENT IDEAS ===
- AnimationCurve gives editor a nice curve editor!! Can be used for something??
- Use 'BroadcastMessage' to notify a tree! -> redo code for hiding pins & such!!
- Use typed arrays!! Ex: List<AnimationClip> mBreaks = new List<AnimationClip>();
- IDEA: Simple reparenting of Sex to top-level objects like a dildo works great!!
	- Parenting entire root tree not good in all situations...  
		- Small hip movement would be more realistic... but for rotation, hip rotate is a MUST
		- So how to rotate hip for tip entry... and move to target??
- Have cursor change to colors dictated by what it's hovering on top off?
- Start developing our COLOR CODE and stick to it throughout.  Color code mouse cursor to pins & actors
- Vertex lit on penis makes it look awesome!  Is that a feasibility or do we need specular??
- For more options and tweaking on animation panel entries, we could simplify by allowing simple adjustments to the 'current animation' (e.g. last entered) to allow user to adjust period, min, max, etc (and save on another name?)
- Growth on breasts limited by clothing... having clothing a larger margin of smoothing of pins would help?
- CSoftBodyVagina and CActorBreasts with CSoftBodyPenis -> Makes it possible to abstract away man, woman and shemale
- Running a collider inside penis during ejaculation will make it look great!!!

=== IMPROVEMENTS ===
- Do we create CHotSpot centrally from CBody??  Would make Unity skeleton less breakable and portable?
- WISH: Would be nice to set root of body to zero instead of this small negative z value... try again?
- Breasts and vagina have different tetra hunt margins... Need to pass in argument!
- Setting friction to zero during penis trust and to some resistance when pulling out would be great!!

=== CURRENT WISHLIST ===
- Would be nice to have CGameEd ability to hide and show stuff based on several buttons and 'broadcast message'! :)
- Duplicate materials between imported body parts and host a hassle...
- Better nipples!
- Fix eyebrows!
- Gloss on vagina

=== LEARN ===
- Application.persistentDataPath: Returns something like: C:/Users/<UserName>/AppData/LocalLow/DefaultCompany/EroticVR
- Can sandwidth long code in profiler sandwitch to show up in nice profiler GUI!
- REMEMBER: Don't ever move static colliders!!!  Add a rigid body, set it kinematic and collider to trigger!  -> revisit entire project on this!
	- Even having cutter cursor not collider trigger & kinematic rigid body caused hard-to-debug PhysX problems -> Be thorough!!!
- Not having any leeway in a configurable joint x,y,z makes rotation goal not work!  (Give at least one degree on each x,y,z for all oBody bones)
- Have two rigid bodies connected by a joint won't make them collide with each other BUT: two bodies away is fair game! (e.g. upper arm to chest problems!)
- Using Transform.LookAt() always provide the 2nd arg for up vector with vectors LOCAL to what we're doing! (ex: CPinSkinned!)
- BakeMesh is about 18ms per call on 25K skinned mesh -> Unsuable on full mesh... but constructing a sub skin-mesh with just the verts I need is probably faster!
- Arrays more than 1D are not serialized! -> Example with CHarnessSphere not serializing 2D array of verts!
- 3ds max not exporting vert colors correctly! -> requiring painful hacks!!!
- Normal bumped diffuse requires tangants!!  (Yet another damn thing to calculate!) -> switched to Mobile Bumped Diffuse wich only needs normals!!
- Unity requires textures in power of 2 or will round DOWN! -> Had to upscale Lorena from 3000x3000 to 4096x4096!!
- Unity capsule length includes the radius at either end!  PhysX 2.8.4 does not!!!
- Copying arrays by aCopy = aOriginal refers to the same element!  Must copy indivually... like that huge bug we had with growth not working because backup array was same as modified array!!
- Very important on softbody meshes that we turn off Unity import setting to 'calculate tangants' -> set to none!
	- 3dsMax Poly selects adds verts even though previous modifier set only one smoothing angle!  This throws off our assumption that no smoothing groups are set for softbody pinning!!  WTF???
- Performing a Mesh Poly / Mesh Smooth or Tesselate will probably result in overlapping UV, which result in Unity shader rendering very poorly around edge of the extra geometry -> Use mesh smooth modifier and test UV with UVW Mapping to bypass this problem!!
	- Mobile/Diffuse with calculated normals and tangants still makes mesh look ok!
- Calculated mesh colliders have a *huge runtime costs*.  A mesh collider left on 'hair' by mistake took 48ms per frame!!!!!
	- Profile is *extremely useful* to know what code and what *instance* costs the most!!
	? Removing mesh collider causes locomotion to crash?  Is animator updating mesh colliders automatically??  (Could be useful!)
- Mesh collider in Unity is flaky... disabling a node with a mesh collider and reenabling it will still have it active in Unity PhysX even though its component was always off! -> Everytime an object with collider becomes active, must toggle component twice to proper level!
- Performance results on cloth collision versus capsules or spheres.  Includes 2 softbody breasts, a 3363 vert / 6442 tri body suit, 355 spheres
	- Spheres: 14.5 and Capsules: 11.2.  Spheres 30% faster.
- Beware that 3dsMax pro optimizer can create a mesh with inverted triangles!  Verify with X-view 'view orientation' before sending to Unity!!
- Trying to get hardware-based cloth was a total failure: Always get the cloth 'popping out' of the way of colliders no matter what was done: relative density, materials, grace distance, iterations, stretching, kinematic, move/set, etc...  (Not to mention limit on about 700 colliders near a cloth!)
- Rotating damn capsules causes heavy cloth jump -> useless.  Trying a 'ping pong' scheme to rotate hidden collider has *HUGE* overhead (many seconds!)  WTF???

=== CURRENT PROBLEMS ===
- Delay between pins to simulation results now visible when model walks fast... how did that break???
	- More visible in editor with multiple windows... but still has 'hickups' and positional lag in max game editor window...
	- Even disabling PhysX GUI updates problem still there
- Why the texture break on each side of breasts & cleavage??
- BUG: Why the bad bounds on breasts & clothing??  (Manually updated)
- Algorithm to find pins by distance highly error prone.  Iterate through edge of soft body to avoid the many problems! -> Set backface to material #2?
- Weird bug that appears intermitently with a particle dancing... goes away if you change detail level of tetramesh -> will cause nasty problems to users!!
- BUG!!!: Why does changing physx properties recreates the mesh colliders??
- BUG!: Clothing broken... One side worse!  And skinned part not moving!  Vert cols??
- CHECK: Why is woman's body mesh center so far off??  (Reset it but can appear again?)
- BUG!: Too many tetramesh verts causes PhysX to not create it at all?  (ex: when growing too much with too-high detail setting)
	- TODO: Trap in C++ for more failures and investigate what is the source...
- Delay between Unity-to-PhysX reared its ugly head again...
	- Is stretching at row zero always bad or did 'growth' make it much worse?  Look under breast!!
+++: Tend to the fucking lag problem!!
- Setting PhysX properties like vagina friction a good thing... go through code and set all props that way!
- Self-collision is a paramater we should control with SetParameter
- Dual scenes (cloth and default) is now all over the place... fix!!
- BUG!!!: Why the game hangs at 612MB about 30% of time???
- Major design changes... with CSoftBodyEx and removal of CActorEx... STUDY CAREFULLY!
- Gravity disabled... hard to lift penis up as it twists... that's what happens with too many links??
- Specularity on vagina doesn't look very good... keep??
- BUG? Man has materials 2&3 set to penis (Sclera & Pupil!) to prevent pinning!
- Penis missing triangles...
- BUG: Penis missing last segment?  -1 a good idea?  Try with 4 segs!!
- Gone with no penis growth? :		//###BUG? //###CHECK - Problem with setting penis growth size.  We MUST have starting state all at scale 1.0 or else the growth mechanism will 'skin twice' and results look poor...  Would need to redo init.
+++ Have huge cock flesh be going up and down from a ring of capsules simulating vagina entry and hand -> will be so HOT!!
+ Important design problem with penis growth: Position of the pins not the same skinned value for big & small...  fixing code for this would be tough... kludge it so it looks ok??
+++ Broken CSoftBodyLocal!!														
--- Simplification of SoftBody got rid of lag between PhysX softbody and Unity, but still a few 'hickups' every second or so when we update PhysX GUI
+ Capping of breast is almost perfect except for some snags around armpits... rework mesh to fix or make algorithm more complex to remove cap??
-- Missing polys near shemale crotch area
- Why the heck is shemale penis requiring such large range for CPinUnity??  Fix mesh??
- Watch for mesh collider on fucking hair!!!
- Watch for fucking weird rotation on body mesh!!  WTF???
?- softbodies won't render if not 2!
- PhysX failure during tetra creation needs to be trapped and reported to Unity... what to do then??
- CBSkin on breasts frequently getting in the way...
	- For breast GUI, having CBSkin and CSoftBodyBreasts give overlapping GUI!
- Breast growth blending gives new mesh smooth verts more distance so they don't expand at the same rate as their neighbor vert -> mesh distortion!  What can be done??
- CBSkin.Awake() called WAY too many times per skinned mesh... and wasting tons of memory per mesh with possibly-unused resources... REDESIGN!
- How the heck can CBSkinEd raycast hit other side of fucking collision mesh???
- Cloth requires healthy collision grace distance... but looks too far -> Have our harness deliver colliders inside body??
- Breast pin of verts no longer working?  Gaps in mesh!
- Massive difference in simulations between GUI or no-GUI -> because of hardcoded 0.04 constant... FIX!!
- Importank leak of about 20K at every power cycle
- Gradual leak of a 1k every few seconds... related to constant creations of mesh in profiler??
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
=== CURRENT DESIGN DISCUSSIONS ===
-- Penetration ---
- Ready for texturing and mesh refining in ZBrush?  Make opening look really nice!
- Get rid of fucking jump when moving legs!  Make it as smooth as possible
	- Add springs to manipulate vagina lips?  A luxury??  Can avoid for a while by spreading thighs upon entry??
- 2-way collision to penis now on...  Is it worth it?  Does it do anything?  test!
- Test vagina as a thick softbody... will make lips fold better?  (How to get best lip folding??)  Could cloth be of use??
- Question: how to best cause labia to stick out nicely... a sphere inside that is slightly larger??
- Driving penis inner core has great effects... soon drive the config joints distance for length enlargment, head enlargment, ejaculation, etc
- Need more penis damping!?  On actors as joint already maxed out!
	- Why is setting slerp drive does nothing!  This is an important setting and we need to control it!!
- Very weird... too many links (20) causes separation of softbody with shaft...  had to increase size of capsules!
- Hook into GUI panel code... subclass CSoftBody from CActor?????
- Remove vagina expansion sphere & collider group??
- Vagina gate still needed???
+ Need to globalize penis ration calculations from penis mesh creation utility and use for everything!
- Would sensors provide any value??... add triggers in Unity PhysX and trap where penis is... also relative spacing between penis tip and vagina opening along its penetraion angle?
	- Sensing when to spread VaginaL/R would be a definite plus...  U/D for 'turned on' and L/R for penis entry??
	- Slow down penis until vagina ready?
- Have a cap at vagina end to prevent sticking out spine? :)
- Compression of penis a problem... how to fix?
- Idea: changing vagina mesh to stick out labia more would yield better results when dick pushing in??
- MASSIVE COCK penetration an absolute must... fuck the female mesh make it happen!
- Spend quite a while with properties tomorrow with each softbody to tune them and keep tuning in code!!
-IDEA: Ops: 3dsMax Skin modifiers nearly useless... replace to mark border, nipple, penis tip, etc
	- Replace skin-based penis growth with new COp system!?

=== CURRENT (CLEANUP) ===
- Rewrote penis chains to 'baked'
	- Create both of them in PhysX too... remove old one... send them... update them.
	- Need to give more leeway for pins now that gaps occur with growth.
		- Balls trapped again... how to prevent?  (Exception in Penis body part?)
	- Need to feed proper params for big and small during init... expose to Unity!
- Textures problem on body.
- Major design weakness exposed with need to reskin twice for growth stage... an afterthought!
	- Make growth stage central to soft body with callback to higher layers skin right before we cache?
	- Will this work with aggregate (breasts and clothing?)
?- Weird stutter when we update PhysX GUI... pins rock steady but resultant mesh dances!
- Penis mostly fixed, but balls don't look nice when legs spread -> looks better with more tetras...
- Remove vagina track in PhysX
- Now fixed penis chain, but small and big penises in PhysX conflict against each other.  Setup collision groups!
	- Redo all collision groups & simplify for new architecture!
	- Dents in penis rim?
- BUG!!!: Soft body cloth handles very differently when we shut off PhysX GUI!!  WTF?  Simulation steps different??
	- Appears to go in that same direction when Unity doesn't have focus and CPU busy...
	- Shutting of GUI and no Unity focus is worst seen
- Sync L/R settings for breasts... changing one changes other

- Start designing our very own breast editor!!!
- Optimize penis and especially balls!!
- Old issue with lag of colliders and dual scenes... fix!
- Design much better breast colliders.
	- Scale breasts colliders radius with breasts!  How to do this cleanly??

=== TOP ISSUE ===
- Big design uncertainty with multiple meshes being managed by the same sequence of ops... who owns what?  What is role of manager, of CBSkin???
- Route blender python error messages back to Unity!!


=== NEXT SESSION ===
- Breast modification design:
	- Got symetry running on breasts just fine because of the mirror copy... but clothing makes this much more complex...
		- Could create a copy node, apply mirror mods to it, run alg from there...
		- Or... manage the arrays themselves??
		- Need to 'average' the two runs on cloth...  so a 'manager' after?

- Design on range of areas... integrate into curve or have a sphere & size??
	- Improve responsivness by auto-refresh when area or origin params change
	- Ops don't 'stack'!
	- Develop stable nipple modifier with auto-position
	- Start designing the final areas and origins...
	- Test which permulation are simplest / most effective
	- Collapse all this complexity into breast class with easy sliders!!
	- Add transparency to 2sided shader!
	- Have 'selection solids' to select verts to act upon...
		- Move these solids just like we do verts with the 4x4 matrix!

- Breast ops -
	- Biggest problem is op 'jumps' when selecting new one... not properly restoring origin & transform to their previous state!
	- Going with the hierarchy mod like 3dsMax... key problem there is range of the operators changes... make do or scale?
	- Start designing the effective ops, curves and centers... and 'register' the 'easy user actions' that each enables!
	- Reset local not working
	- Now system of 'registering' the 'easy ops' for sliders
	- Really keeping fixed locations in mesh?  Not looking up from sliders or anything?
	- Would be nice to auto-refresh when changing vert selection, center, gizmo, etc...  (REMOVE AUTOREFRESH)
	- Nipple affect breast range?? 

- New autocapsule from harness -
	- Still some bad issues with movement... probably won't be able to make it work, but can do fine statically!
	- In radius reduction, add tests for tri center, then possibly edge midpoints?  Make damn sure we never protrude.
	- Go for cloth fitting at this point -> reimplement cloth just for static cloth designer being 'baked' into softbodies with breasts...
	- Might be possible to get things working for penis in shorts with mostly skinned shorts with front being softbody?  YES
	
- Latest cloth retests:
	- Finally have reasonable solution to autofit cloth to breast expansion...
	- Cloth stretching & bending very important...
			
- Design simplification
	- CClothSplitter will be needed by woman top clothing and (possibly) mens/shemale shorts.  It should only run during import time???  LEARN HOW
	- Cloth simulation only used to fit clothing over expanding breasts (non skinned part only)  Useless for any gametime experience?  (Could it be used for men's shorts??)

- New 'dual gameplay mode' design:
	- Designer-mode: interactive mode where user gets to moodify body parts and clothing is adjusted.  (For all growth stages)
		- Output of this interaction is (for breasts)
		- An 'automated mode' can perform this behind the scene given the parameters for each body part & growth stage
	- Game-mode: Populates the gaming structure from the input of the above.
		
- Cloth fitting mode
	- Normals a problem
	- Performance very poor... add 'smarts' to CHarness to only turn on / process colliders close to active objects!

- Merge of cloth and breasts:
	- Now mostly working... cleanup!
	- Completely redesign breasts around new CBreasts
	- Nipples: Are we forced to pin that part of the cloth... have to start planning!
		- Even with that... would it be enough or could verts poke through breasts during linear interpolate??
	- Need partial harness with softbody clothing otherwise some motions will cause poke through -> need to optimize CHarness to only create & update needed colliders!

- Cloth fitting
	- Create a centralized startup mode from CGame that makes the dual game modes very clear.
	- Cloth jumps right after creation... no longer pinned??
	- We're going to need to affect cloth params easily...
	- Offer a cloth reset... repin to start, or temporarily disable colliders? (Simply removing collision between the two groups should be fast)
	- Breasts during cloth fit drawn twice with two materials... how can this be?   Possible bug?  Are we setting two triangle submeshes??
	- Breast mash broken again...
	
	- Collider popping cloth when moving our biggest problem... have to hide cloth, recalc harness at end, set cloth to bigger size and then redraw and release for refit everytime!
	- ?NOW need correct mesh transfer between the two meshes at breast and top!
	
	- Can now most go between the two modes
		- When going back to cloth mode, cloth vertices are 'stretched' to previous state!
		- Going back again to gamemode crashes!
		- That piling up of materials on breasts to make em white... fix!
		- Complain about negative radius!
	- Idea: perhaps mode changing is too difficult to do right -> just reload the scene (or a different one?)

	- Grueling fucking day fucking around with import...
		- Import a bit better but still have trouble visualizing our meshes.
		- Now have clothing mode ok, going to softbody ok (missing textures) but going back fails again on bones... transfer bones once at beginning!
		- Revisit whole code and SIMPLIFY THE FUCKIN THING!

- Cloth cutting in blender
	- In 1 day was able to ship mesh and cutter!
	- Cutter resolution!
	- Avoid creation at every update?
	- Need to solidify cutter, ship mesh back to Unity for visulization of what cutter will cut
	- Improve reception of commands, avoid closing socket everytime, have error report, etc...
	- Make socket call async or blocking??
	- Remember the nice code snippet library!
	- When game control of cutter points is possible, remember to standardize what can be done in pos/rot/scale x/y/z			

	- Can now send mesh and pretty good cutter...
		- Need to convert cutter to mesh first?
		- Unity still splits verts at material boundaries but Blender won't work with dup verts...
			- Can perform a 'remove duplicates' in blender, but Unity would then have shitty textures?  TEST
				- Can wrap / unwrap these dup verts in Unity so blender wont see em'
		- Curiously, 'Union' boolean mode appears very close to desired result... use that one??
		
		Consider Mesh.CombineMeshes 
		
?BUG??? WTF does it take two shots of large sphere behind cloth to get cloth to fit to tits???  (Problem gone now??)

- Lessons learned from trying to fit breasts by top formed of colliding spheres -
	- Soft body appears extremely porous to any small collider spheres under .2!  A .5 meter radius sphere is extremely repelling tho!  WTF??
	- Thorough tests with density of colliders versus soft body yielded no change!  Only used when applying forces to softbody verts??
	- Reducing stretching stiffness important to reduce forces needed... ok to leave volume high
	- Soft body Particle radius is very important and .2 appears to improve... but even then the solution is hardly stable...
	- Having this be the largest possible value greatly increases stability!!!  So reduce size of collider!!
	- A small number of large spheres appear quite effective, but too many yields garbage!
	- Extreme smoothing would be a must... and then cloth refit after...
	- Still uncertain as max number of colliders soft body can have... error appears but is that for cloth during cloth fitting stage??	+++ These problems are important to resolve for tits to collider convincingly against hands and other objects!!!
		- This situation is far more important than breast fitting to cloth... we need to have tits moving to hands and have them look smooth and great!!  WORK ON THIS FIRST, THEN BREAST FIT MAY WORK!
		- Best result so far: Tiny sphere colliders with soft body skin widht of 15 has a significant pushing power.
		- LEARN: Duplicating colliders at same place gives no change, but placing them a short distance away helps! -> Part of the solution???
		- Drop to about 5 fps when we get to 100 tiny colliders, with no great improvement in repell power.  (Dispersing them in full 3D helps a bit...)
	- BREAKTHROUGH: Cube the size of a pin-head with 10 softbody particle has amazing repell power...
		- Softbody looks bad tho... :-(  Because outer layer goes inside the next layer in!
		- Interesting: Even a pinhead cube has huge effect when rotated -> the skin width around it is a huge cube!
		- LEARN: Having razor-thin cube causes softbody tetras to get 'caught' behind and require a huge pull away to reset! -> Make cube thick to resolve this!
	- ALTERNATIVE: Capsule has almost the same repell power as cube but doesn't suffer from having skin width multiplying its sharp corners!
		- So we can have a cloth mesh emulated by having edges = capsules!!!
		- Radius does have an effect... pinhead has less repell!
		- When capsule looks like a sphere it repells like a sphere = like shit!
		- 15 softbody skin widht has ample repell power... 12 gets a bit weak but can be compensated with copies.  5 just too weak!
	- BEST SO FAR:
		- Cube with a lot of 'depth' (so we don't get stuck)
		- Particle radius around 3 starts getting good pushing power.
		- As low as 2 is possible with high iteration count (4) and larger surface on box collider.
		- Volume stiffness at 1, bend high like .5 is ok too with box but starts becoming unstable!
		- DAMP during cloth = 0
		- Density of 46 seems to work... 45 crashes!
		

- Next on breast collision:
	- Well absolutely need fast smooth.  We go nowhere without that!
	- Increasing iteration count to 2 reduses to 7fps but can be tighter!
		- Being this tight won't of course be possible during fast gameplay, so need wider range there...
	- We'll need to run this at very high density... fix code to make it robust!  (Try to trap jerkiness??)
	- Also: poke through between cloth and breast... this is what happens if outer layer goes inside??

- Decisions to simplify breast collisions -
	- Hand to breast:
		- Have hand wrap around breast mesh with the help of blender and keep it glued to breast as it moves.
		- Apply various 'hand push' vectors to the neighboring particles to the hand to simulate breast motion without local breast deformations
	- Breast to environment (body of partner, furniture, etc)
		- have to go with cubes and capsules... but will be difficult to make look nice.
	- Smoothing is critical																
	- The latest: Collision with primitives is critical for other body and furniture, but for hands we'll go with fields to move the whole breast

- List of modifications of DAZ mesh:
	- Rotated by WORLD top-level node
	- Sized mesh verts to Unity meter scale with 1.0 Blender scale
	- Removed the eyebrow verts & group
	- Removed groups: bodyMorphs, bmilwomxxx, 
	- Triangulated
	- Trimmed bone limit to 4
	- Normalized all weight groups
	- Cut off hands & feet, head and breasts
	- Renamed textures
	- Removed EyeTear & EyeSocket & EyeSurfacea verts & material
	-Questions: Tongue?  Jaw?  Teeth?  Simplify head?
				
- gBlender improvements:
	- Need to clarify ownership of bone tree and document
	- Mods to mesh: removed bmilwom and bodymorph and removed eyebrow verts & group.  Added _ to all our non-bones
	- What is the deal with one vert with zero weight?  14598 = Behind ear!
		- WTF is wrong with that fucking vert?  Setting it in Blender then reloading still set, but on next run with Unity gets corrupted again!  (Our code corrupts!)
		- Removing normalize fixes it... but is probably related to that one vert error with the bad vert group 1162170942
		(Add back normalized when fixing this bad vert)
	- Seams & mat boundaries visible at some cam/light angles... Copy blender's normals??
	- Have to fix extra materials without textures!
	
	
=== Gizmo integration ===
- Have sendmessage to camera no recipient...
- Create invisible targets on the go?


======================================================

=== NEXT ===
- Multi-curves, active curve, curve colors, GUI
- Load and save by 'type'... going in/out of special folders for 'Top' / 'Side' / 'Bottom'
	- Define 'sets' that load each from proper category...

=== TODO ===
- Names of hotspots showing
	- Would be nice to take them out of root.
	- Deletion?
- Start the concept of 'active edited curve' and passive with GUI menu

=== DESIGN ===

=== PROBLEMS ===
- Game init also creates cloth final for direct go to game??
- Going back to cloth cut resets to base!
- Breast pins moved??
- Softbody not created sometime a red flag... need to trap its failure and recreate at different density
- Game startup mode and GUI tab duplicity a pain...

=== PROBLEMS??? ===
-? Seams appearing in play mode... normals adjusted?
-? Problem deleting CSkinBaked! -
-? Rotate y inverted!?

=== WISHLIST ===
- Color of hotspots and curve
- BodyCol efficiency could use some control in Unity
